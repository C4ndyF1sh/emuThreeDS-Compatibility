state-playable means that the game is fully playable.

state-ingame means somewhat playable past title screens (including with graphics bugs, crashes, saving, loading and other major problems).

state-intro means nothing but an intro/opening of the game is shown (such as a video/animation/company name/etc.).

state-loadable means that the game is capable of being read but can't actually start/run yet. If the game is at least trying to run some frames (framerate is anything other than zero), should be reported as loadable and not nothing.

state-nothing means that the game won't even be read by the emulator and/or crashes the emulator before the game even gets to show much of anything.
